        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I created a blank document on November 2<sup>nd</sup> and published my book ‚Äú<a href="https://gum.co/junior-to-senior/" target="_blank">Junior to Senior: How to Level Up as a Software Engineer</a>‚Äù on December 21<sup>st</sup> 2020, exactly 50 days later. This initial version of the book is 52,660 words (the PDF file is 135 pages).</p>
          <p>Here‚Äôs why and how I did it.</p>
          <h2 id="why-write-a-book">Why write a book?</h2>
          <p>Writing a book is a rite of passage. I was always a hoarder of knowledge and rarely shared what I had collected, except for writing documentation and guides at work, and teaching people in person.</p>
          <p>As is the case with most developers, my personal blog has been sitting almost empty for years: why share something if it‚Äôs you who has a problem, and you are the one solving it? The effort to write up a solution in a linear, organized way seemed excessive; I had my notes and they were enough.</p>
          <p>It was supposed to go like this:</p>
          <p><img src="https://norikitech.com/posts/a-book-written/files/202101201313/lateral_move.png" alt="‚ÄúLateral Move‚Äù cover and table of contents"></p>
          <p>Notice the subtitle: ‚ÄúThe bored software developer‚Äôs guide to researching, learning and getting excited about new tech.‚Äù There is a large crossover with the contents of ‚ÄúJunior to Senior,‚Äù but when I started writing the introduction I realized that you had to be in a very specific situation for the advice to be useful‚Äîand what I suggested didn‚Äôt suit many people either. I would be better off not following this advice myself, as I mentioned in the section <em>Help your company teach you</em> of ‚ÄúJunior to Senior‚Äù:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Earlier in my career, I have left companies over lack of learning, but looking back, I understand that I could have had more learning freedom in a familiar project and in a company that trusted me.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>I scrapped everything and started again.</p>
          <h3 id="junior-to-senior">‚ÄúJunior to Senior‚Äù</h3>
          <p><em>(begin excerpt)</em></p>
          <p>As I began writing this book, I knew that I would face strong resistance (because ‚Äúwrite a book‚Äù is the vaguest todo item in the world), so I used every trick that I knew to help myself write every day:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Make other people expect your work.</strong> Probably, the best thing I did was to offer the book for preorder with a set release date. I‚Äôm very serious about my promises to other people (Rick Astley starts playing). Just the thought that I‚Äôve promised to do something by some day helps me sit down and do the work. If you only do something for yourself, you can easily make an excuse and avoid working, but you can‚Äôt go back on your promise and make up an excuse for other people. At work, I know my teammates expect and rely on the tasks I do, so I try to never let them down. Reputation beats procrastination.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove distractions, at least in the beginning.</strong> Often the bump that we need to cross to begin working on a big task is relatively small, but when there‚Äôs a distraction available without friction, we choose that instead. I write on a very slow Linux computer that can‚Äôt play music, has no internet, and my phone is on silent, face down, in another room. There is ‚Äúfog‚Äù in my head when I sit down to write, and I sit there and stare at the screen for ten minutes. But the fog is me thinking about how to start and what I want to say in the section. I need those ten minutes of initial concentration to break through the resistance of the task. If I had a distraction, I would probably take it. What also helps is having a notebook that you keep in front of you when starting, so that you can write down what you want to do about the task first, like a small todo list. I find that after I start, I can stay in work mode until I‚Äôm done, even through small distractions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>(end excerpt)</em></p>
          <p>For generating the PDF, I started with <a href="https://gitlab.com/pianomanfrazier/pandoc-markdown-book" target="_blank">this code</a> and modified it for my needs, while still using the <a href="https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template" target="_blank">Eisvogel</a> template. I also used <a href="https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/" target="_blank">PDFtk</a> to attach the cover after compiling the PDF. The generation script is as follows:</p>
          <pre><code>
pandoc --pdf-engine=latexmk --template=./templates/eisvogel.latex --highlight-style tango --shift-heading-level-by=-1 --number-sections --top-level-division=chapter -o build/text.pdf src/title.txt src/01.md

pdftk cover.pdf build/text.pdf cat output build/junior-to-senior.pdf
          </code></pre>
          <p>LaTeX (required by Pandoc for the PDF conversion) was <a href="https://twitter.com/karabatov/status/1340222431361978374" target="_blank">a little tricky</a> to set up, but finally I went with <a href="https://miktex.org/" target="_blank">MiKTeX</a> and it went smoothly.</p>
          <p>A friend told me that I was the first person they knew who decided to write a book and wrote it. That‚Äôs worth something?</p>
